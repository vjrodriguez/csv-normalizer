# The problem: CSV normalization
csv-normalizer is a CLI tool built with Node.js to normalize csv files with funky inputs!
## How to run this app 
 * Clone or download this repo
 * $ cd csv-normalizer
 * $ npm install
 * $ node ./ sample.csv output.csv 

  This will run all the specs you need to normalize a CSV file and create a new normalized version for you! 
  
  If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, [here](https://repl.it/@VickyRodriguez1/csv-normalizer#index.js) is an IDE that works exactly the same way!
